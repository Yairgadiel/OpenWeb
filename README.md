# Welcome to OpenWeb Android interview üôÇ #

We are going to build a simple app which will show all the pok√©mons

- There will be a title, a description and an horizontal list of pok√©mons.
- The user can tap each pok√©mon and see more details about it in a separate screen.
- A service which return the pok√©mons and `Pokemon` structure already developed and created for you.
- Your job is to use them and build this app.
- You can use any 3rd party libraries you would like.
- The app should support all orientations. Tablets can be ignored.
<br/>

To begin, open the project folder.<br/>
Wait for gradle sync to finish and run the project, that's the screen you supposed to see:
<br/>

  <img src="Screenshots/Welcome.png" width="277" height="570" align="center">
</p>

<br/><br/>
The end result should look something like the following sketchup:
<br/>
